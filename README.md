# Small-Large Tasks I used an event driven architectural pattern to implement a dynamic observer for concurrency over work stations.## MotivationSometimes we have a broker such as rabbitMQ andwe want to distribute work among workers. The worker has two types of listeners:<br><br><i>Small Tasks:</i>This tag is assigned to those tasks which are not cpu intensive anddoes not need to create an individual thread for each of them, so our event driverarchitectures can register for this tag and dispatches the appropriate event handler.The event handler can use a thread pool to do the task.<br><br><i>Large Tasks:</i>This tag is assigned to very time consuming tasks. A good idea is to create a new thread and terminate the thread wheneverit is complete.<br>Step1: ![GitHub Logo](uml2.png) <br>After successfull compilation:<br>from server1:a large task is received<br>from server2:a large task is received<br>from server1:simple calculation! a small task is received<br>from server2:quick translation! a small task is received<br>from server1:quick speech recognition! a small task is received<br>from server1:a large task is received<br><br>to be continued...
